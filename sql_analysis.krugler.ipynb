    "I thought it would be interesting to find some empirical data about the one and only Yosemite that could prove useful for Texino. There is a huge percentage of campers in Yosemite that either use a van or RV. Without a doubt this is one of the most traveled spots in the world and if Texino could set up some sort of tour program with various stops to maximaze the consumers experience it would give them a stronger image in the eyes of the competition.\n",
